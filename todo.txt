// Debugging

    Instead of
    # ionic serve -o

    Previously do (only once)
    # ionic cordova platform add browser

    And run it through
    # ionic cordova run browser

// Deploying (assuming firebase tools, initalization and project already setup)

    Under ./hectris
    # ionic build --prod

    Then go to the compiled code
    # cd www

    Test it
    # http-server -o

    If its ok, get back to home dir and deploy
    # cd ..
    # firebase deploy
